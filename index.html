      <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth
        a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its
        axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides,
        creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The
        Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
        Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in
        our solar system. Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the
        Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo
        Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. NASA currently
        has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon – Lunar Reconnaissance
        Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft (not to be confused with NASA's
        new Artemis program to send astronauts back to the Moon).
        <br /><br />The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around
        the Earth at a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers). The
        Earth and Moon are tidally locked. Their rotations are so in sync we
        only see one side of the Moon. Humans didn't see the lunar far side
        until a Soviet spacecraft flew past in 1959. The Moon has a solid, rocky
        surface cratered and pitted from impacts by asteroids, meteorites, and
        comets. The Moon has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere called an
        exosphere. It is not breathable. More than 105 robotic spacecraft have
        been launched to explore the Moon. It is the only celestial body beyond
        Earth – so far – visited by human beings. The Moon was the first place
        beyond Earth humans tried to reach as the Space Age began in the late
        1950s. More than 100 robotic explorers from more than half a dozen
        nations have since sent spacecraft to the Moon. Nine crewed missions
        have flown to the Moon and back. Artemis logo With Earth Blue, Rocket
        Red and Lunar Silver for colors, every part of the identity has meaning.
